### First Practical Work for the .Net Programming Course

* Submit a Visual Studio solution containing two projects, the first should be called “HelloWorld” and the second project “ByeWorld”.

* The first console type application should send an output with the text "Hello World" and the second one with the text "Goodbye World".

* In the "Chau Mundo" application, the text should not appear as soon as I open the application, but must wait for the Enter key to be pressed.
